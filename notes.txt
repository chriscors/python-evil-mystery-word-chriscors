Ok so when you start we get a word of a random length

Then you guess a letter, it checks to make sure there are words with that letter in it

Then it removes all the words that dont have that letter in it

Then it makes buckets f words thatbhave the letter in the open spaces of the possible word

Returns the largest bucket as list of new word
